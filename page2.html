	<p>Punisher is an album that is very complex. With themes of depression, anxiety, self identity/reflection, and losing someone. Her lyrics tell multiple stories at once, all tying together with a common theme. She expresses a fear of losing someone forever. Phoebe is in a bad with her two friends Julien Barker and Lucy Dacus and they all come together in the song "Graceland Too." This song is theorized to be bout Julien, who struggled with depression and suicidal tendencies. The first line in the song is "No longer a danger to herself or others," saying how she no longer has plans to take her own life. At the end of that verse, she says "She could go home but she's not going to," refferencing Julien's song "Go Home" where she sings about her depression and suicide. This song is very meaningful, especially since I have many people I care about who dealiing with something similar. Another star song on the album is "Punisher." This song is a good symbol of self reflection as there is a 'you' character who is the 'way to her heart.' There is a line that says "I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face" and when listening with a broader perspective, there is a lingering theme of anxiety. She does not want this person to have self-doubt, scared of how they would react. She ends the song saying "Wouldn't know where to start, wouldn't know where to stop," highlighting her rush of emotions. 'Moon Song' tells the story of a complicated relationship. She, in a way, yearns for this relationship to the point she would wait for the person to want her again rather than moving on. Death is mentioned many times throughout the song, the analogy "Like a dog with a bird at your door" when refferiing how she will wait. This line is significant to remember because at the end of the song she says "When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying But you know the killer doesn't understand." In a way, she romanticizes death because of the intimacy of their relationship. All in all, this album does a good job complicating and uncomplication emotions, being very relatable while telling a story.  </p>
