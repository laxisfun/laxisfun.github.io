	<p>Lorde is an artist who can see color in songs. She uses this as a creative tool in her songwriting amd album creation. Melodrama paints a picture of one transitioning into adulthood, themes of a first hearthbreak, self-discovery, solitude, and partying. There are two songs on thus tracklist entitled "Sober" and "Sober II" talking the two people who casually hook-up on the weekends, as if these meetings are a drug. In Sober, the chorus says "Ain't a pill that could touch our rush (But what will we do when we're sober." This goes into her theme of heartbreak and partying because they are trying to pretend they don't care because they know it won't last, hurting the both of them. In Sober II, she does more into the self-discovery theme because she questions who she will be without this person. After she is off this high, who is she? These songs together are significant to people going into adulthood because no matter the perpsective, you feel the emotions and the vulnerable atmosphere. In her song 'Liablility,' she faces solitude and self doubt after getting her heart broken as she writes "He don't wann know me Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm Says it ws poison." She comes to a revalation that she is too much for everyone and anyone. In the second verse, she says "every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone Better on my own." This is significant because it shows some kind of acceptance and sadness in being alone. In "Green Light," she goes over the awkwardness in breaking up without closure and still seeing each other. It mixes themes of heartache and yearning at the same time as in the first verse she sings "I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar." This shows that even though the broke up, she wants the closure and proves that she still knows them, even after all that happened. As someone who went through a breakup filled with lies, I understand and relate to this song deeply. It's never easy to just throw everything away and move on like nothing happened, especially if there is no closure. She touches into the part where your friends are still friends so they'll always be around each other, waiting for the 'Green Light; when they would get closure. this album is overall relatable to teens and college students how are exploring their personal life and going through a first breakup. Instead of it forcing one to move on, it lets the listener reflect on what happened.</p>
