	<p>Music has been a big part of my life since I was a child. My mom took this photo of me with wired headphones on when I was a toddler and I think it resembles me with great familiarity. I have used music to get through hard times and I feel like these albums, every song in them, are able to touch everyone's heart how it does mine. The lyricism is very complex and it exites me to share these beauty's to others. I primarily use apple music but I linked all the albums to a youtube video, a common app that most people use. </p>
