	<p>This album is a very complex album talking about love, loss, identity, and morality. It does a great deal talking about his sexulity as he is bisexual. In Solo, he speaks of his personal life, going into his party life including him doing drugs and a hypothetical relationship with a 'you' character. He says "inahale, in Hell there's Heaven" which goes into his sexuality because though being gay is seen as a sin, he feels Heaven. In this same song, he speaks about him having to pay for an abortion. This dual perspective is very complex and it goes into sexuality and lonliness as at the end of the song he inevitably ends up 'rolling solo.' He also goes into more modern terms in Good Guy when it speaks of him and a man, when they text first, then meeting in person. Though a short song, the line that sticks out to me the most is "here's to the highlights when I was convinced That this was so much more than just some night shit." This shows how their relationship, though starting as a one night stand, turned into so much more for him but no nec </p>
