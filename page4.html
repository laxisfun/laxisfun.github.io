	<p>Lush is a very complex album that has lyricism so strong that it makes you feel so much. There are themes of objectification, beauty standards, feminine rage, and a toxic relationship. The song "Bag of Bones" shows clear themes of all of these, highlighting objectification and a toxic relationship. The chorus says "Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart" with the following line asking for mercy. The fact that she says this character tears her apart so casually shows that this is not the first time. This toxicity is ongoing. Objectifications best form would be in the second verse where she sings "Just move the stuff up on the bed And do what you came here to do." It is very clear that what she feels is irrelevant and that she is only usefull to him when he uses her body. She is treated as a toy and it seems as if she doesn't know anything other than that as she ends the song singing "I can take a little bie more Let's shake this poet out of the beast." She is, in a way, trapped and feels like she has to continue to be an object to stay in this relationship. In that last line she is not telling him, she is trying to convince herself. Female rage can be seen in the song "Eric" and she starts off saying "You like control, well, I do too." This is her trying to take power over a situation in which she is letting him hurt her. Her anger is translating into power as she takes control of the situation from her perspective. She is upset that she is not allowed to love him because she knows "the rules." In the second verse, she gets a little louder and faster, in an angry but desperate tone. She can't help being in this toxic relationship, willing to play the price of whatever it takes to be his. At the end of the song, she sings "I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you What's my, what's my, what's my price?" She is in a blinded anger and desperation for him. In Abbey, we get a glimpse into beauty standards as she starts the song singing "I am hungry I have been hunrgy I was born hungry." She cannot satisfy her hunger because she needs to fit into these beauty standards. When she is blacking out from the hunger, she sees the light of the body she wants. She sings "There is a light, I feel it in me But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me," speaking of her body. She feels the 'light' she she is at her breaking point, not being able to starve any longer. At the end of the song, she sings "There is a dream and it sleeps in me To awake in the night, crying, "Set me free" and I awake every night, crying, "Set me free."" This is the dream of being 'perfect' and she needs to set it free or else she will be hurt. Many young girls get hoaxed into relationships with toxic guys that they will do anything for and Mitski embodies that in her album. Also, many girls suffer with eating disorders so she does a good job talking about it without being too direct, also emphasizing the pain it causes. This is overall a very emotion-heavy album.</p>
